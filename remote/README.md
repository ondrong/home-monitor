# web interface for home-monitor

You have already seen how it looks, so without further ado let's get to it.

## directory structure

**web-root* is, well, just that - the root folder in your webhosting.
**banana* is the actual directory where the magic happens and it contains the actual html/php/js part of home-monitor. Why is it called banana then? Cause as I've already mentionted I run local part of the home-monitor on BananaPi and initial codename for this repository was banana-monitor. :-)
